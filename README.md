## About This Monorepo

This repository is part of WebinarGeek's commitment to building tools that streamline state machine development for internal projects and the broader developer community.

### Key Features

- Tools specifically tailored for XState v5.
- TypeScript-first approach for better type safety and developer experience.
- Modular designâ€”each package is independently usable.
- Optimized for performance and DX (Developer Experience).
